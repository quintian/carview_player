Overview

CarView is an app seeking to streamline needed smartphone functionality for drivers. CarView will bring together navigation, audio, and phone calling into a simple, easy-to-use dashboard that will help minimize driver distraction without loss of functionality. Furthermore, it will step into the gap left by Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which remain limited to certain vehicle makes, models, and model years. CarView, in contrast, will be available to any user with a compatible smartphone, regardless of the car they drive.

How to run
